# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
This project is about helping Louise to fundraise her new play named *fever*. We therefore analyzed the data from the Kickstarter campaigns to determine what is the best time to launch her campaign. We filtered out months to determine which month is best to launch the campaign and money value to determine what is the goal to set for this campaign. In the end, we are able to make line graphs from the pivot tables we generalized to make relevant assumptions.
### Purpose
We want to help Louise to find out a best time for Louise to launch her campaign during this year.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In this analysis, we created a line graph based on months of the year and the numbers of successful launched campaigns are shown in the graph. We filtered out category theater and sort out the successful, failed and canceled campaigns by months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In this analysis, we setted different money value and filtered out play to create a line graph which shows the successful launched campaigns under different money value goals. The different value of money range from the lowest which is less than 1000, to the highest which is 50000 or more. We created a line graph based on the information which shows the percentage of successful, failed and canceled launched campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
We have to sort out the data and apply the right functions in order to create graphs that can visualize the information we want to extract. Therefore, we need to make sure the correct functions were being used when we were data pre processing. 
## Results
From the outcomes based on launch date data, we can conclude that May has launched the highest successful campaigns while December has launched the least campaigns. From the outcomes based on goals data, we can conclude that money value goal that is setted less than 1000 has the highest percentage successful.
The data should also include information about people's ages in order for us to retrieve audience's demographic so we know what audience group are we targeting for out campaign.
